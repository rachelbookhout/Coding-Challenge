     ​ <h1> Rachel-sensei, <h1>
        <p> For this short time we have known each other, thank you. Not only for English class since we were not really able to speak but for the things we did not understand, thank you so much for teaching us and making it easy for us to understand them</p>
         <p> We had the experience of watching you work with us to clean the hallway. Seeing that figure, silently working on cleaning, giving it everything, we thought it was very earnest and that you were a good teacher. We thought it was amazing that you would do such regular things with us everyday</p>
        <p> We want you to teach more students the importance of cleaning. For the short time we have known each other, thank you very much </p>

        <p> This was a note I recieved from one of my classes before they graduated to high school. Students are required to clean the school everyday, which means all of the sweeping, cleaning of the chalk boards, emptying of garbage cans, etc. is done by them, and for the time I was there, me. Every day, I would sweep the 2nd floor hallway with my students and if one of them was absent, clean the floors by hand with a wet rag. Teachers normally don't participate in the cleanings, but I didn't think it was fair to have my students getting themselves dirty if I wasn't willing to get my suit dirty, too.

         More then anything I have done or experienced in my life, the year I studied in Japan and the year I worked in Japan have shaped who I am and how I view the world. I spent two school years studying Japanese and an entire summer reviewing before I studied abroad, and I found I wasn't at all prepared to handle the demands of interacting with people in Japanese all day or going about my daily routine in a foreign country. I had learned all of these things, but never had the chance to put it to practical use before arriving in the country. I was scared to make mistakes or to be thought of as dumb if I didn't understand what someone was saying to me. I was constantly drained from struggling to understand the world around me, frustrated by my ineptness and failure to convert on my knowledge and promise, and felt isolated because it seemed to me that all the other students were breezing through the experience.

         However, as time passed, it got easier for me. I learned to 我慢する (gaman suru), which translates as "to be patient", but in reality, means to slog through the hardship and embrace the struggle of it. I worked on making Japanese friends so I could practice what I was learning and have assistance with the day-to-day issues that I found myself having. I worked on developing more confidence in myself and my ability to handle any situation that came up. This was what led me to do as much traveling as I have done and indirectly has led me to apply to Launch Academy.
