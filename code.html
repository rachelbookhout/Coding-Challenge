     	<h1> My Journey to Web Development <h1>
<p>
My journey to pursuing a career in web development is not as random as it sometimes feels to me. When I was 10 years old, my twin sister and I created a website for our elementary school, showcasing the class of 1999, the year we graduated. I don't remember much about it other than it had a lot of tacky clip-art, that an article was written about us in the local paper, and we won the competition that we had created it for. We maintained it for over a year, but eventually it drifted away on the list of priorities of a 6th grader. 
 </p>
<p>
	I considered taking computer science courses when I was attending Smith College, but only one class was offered on our campus and all other classes to finish the major were at other affiliated colleges, a long bus ride away. It was too much of a time commitment if it was something I became passionate about and the one class that was offered at Smith was always offered opposite Japanese class. Therefore, I shelved the idea.
</p>
<p>
	Fast forward a couple of years, I was in the middle of nowhere, Japan, teaching English. I found myself with a lot of free time so I started looking for ways to further my education during my down-time. This is when I discovered Code Academy. The only paths there at this time were HTML and CSS which I quickly devoured.  I credit Code Academy for helping to keep me sane through that year.
	</p>
	<p>
When I returned to the States, I forgot about the fun I had using Code Academy. I had too much on my plate to deal with -- grief, new city, and a never-ending job hunt. It was through the job hunt that I was introduced to the start-up world.  Every day,  I was going to a job where my creativity was underutilized and I saw no future where I would be leaving soon. I felt that the only way I would survive was to pour my energy into a side project and with this, I began applying and interviewing for positions at start-ups. Around the time I began working for booking.com, I started helping my friend with his various start-ups. I did everything I could do - recruiting, legal research, accounting, etc. - but my lack of technical skills was a hindrance for me truly aiding him.  So, I started Code Academy again, started taking CS courses on Coursera, and signed up for my first Railsbridge.  
</p>
<p>
Learning HTML and CSS had been fairly easy for me once someone had explained it as resembling the movie “Inception”.  Ruby was different – the first couple of times I worked with it was like reading a sentence in a foreign language and being able to translate every word but unable to decipher the meaning. As I have learned more over the past months, I have come to enjoy the challenge of making it work for me and am excited to continue learning. 
</p>
<h1> Why I would be a good candidate for Launch Academy <h1>
  <ol>
    <li>  I have been in an immersive learning environment.</li>
<ul><li> I know what it takes to remain focused and not get overwhelmed by the steady stream of new information and the pressure to retain and utilize it immediately. </li></ul>
<br>
<li>I already live in Boston, have connections to the developer/start-up community, and plan to stay here upon completing Launch Academy. </li>
<ul><li>To completely upend your life to go after your dreams is a big adjustment. I will have far less of an adjustment because I have a support system in Boston and the primary challenge I will have in my life during my time at Launch Academy will be academic, not getting acquainted with a new city or lifestyle.  </li></ul>
<br>
<li> I intend to use the knowledge I will gain at Launch Academy for good. </li>
<ul><li>   Women’s colleges exist primarily to empower women to achieve anything they dream of and to push the boundaries of what a woman can or cannot do in the eyes of the world. But even among the fearless, intelligent ladies who attended Smith College with me, many are terrified of coding. They think it is too foreign and difficult and that it’s a guy thing. Until very recently, I believed that too. That alarms me and I am disappointed in my past self. How much innovation and creativity is being stifled because the girls of my generation, maybe the next as well, are never taught not to fear technology or that it is something they can control and bend to their will, not a creature they only mildly understand, but use for everything? I would like to be able to mentor young girls and foster their interest in computers and coding and help them be prepared for the world they will inhabit when they hit their adulthood. I would like also to be an example for the people who I know and have yet to meet, that occupations are not gendered and it is outdated to think so.</li></ul> 
</ol>
<p> Regardless if I am accepted into Launch Academy or not, I have expanded my knowledge of HTML, CSS, Git,  Ruby, and Javascript and have learned and done more than I ever imagined I would. After all, I built my first website!  I plan to keep learning, be it through Launch Academy or if need be, by myself, and I will become a web developer. </p>
